📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline that collects weather data from an open API, processes it, and stores it in a cloud-based data warehouse for analysis and visualization. It’s designed to showcase skills in data ingestion, transformation (ETL), orchestration, and data modeling.

🧱 Tech Stack
Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API

Ingestion: Python + Requests

Transformation: DBT (Data Build Tool)

Orchestration: Apache Airflow

Storage: PostgreSQL / AWS Redshift / BigQuery (choose based on your setup)

Visualization: Optional (e.g., Metabase, Power BI, or Looker Studio)

🛠️ Features
⏱️ Scheduled data ingestion (current and forecast weather)

🧹 Cleans and transforms raw JSON data into structured tables

🏗️ Modular pipeline with Airflow DAGs

🔁 Daily automated runs with monitoring and logging

💡 Supports historical backfill and incremental loading

🚀 How It Works
Ingest: Fetches weather data using Python scripts from OpenWeatherMap API

Store Raw Data: Saves the raw JSON data into a staging table

Transform: Uses DBT to clean, model, and load data into analytics-ready tables

Schedule: Orchestrated via Apache Airflow to run daily and handle retries

✅ Skills Demonstrated
API integration and data extraction

Data pipeline design and orchestration with Airflow
